RST completion plugin
=====================

What is it?
-----------

This is MonoDevelop plugin that aim is to make editing **reStructuredText** more pleasant. Currently it is in early stage of development. I'll try to keep the features list up to date. One day I'll probably make some screenshots or a video.

Features
--------

* Completion on titles/subtitles. For example write *Blah*, press **ENTER**, then write `-`, completion will be proposed.
* Auto-adjusting title/subtitle underline. Just edit formerly completed *Blah*.
* Bullet list edition help. When you create the first bullet list entry, pressing **ENTER** will move you to the new, auto-inserted entry. Also works with multi-level bullet lists and keeps the proper indent.

Need a feature, found a bug?
----------------------------

Just make an issue on github.
